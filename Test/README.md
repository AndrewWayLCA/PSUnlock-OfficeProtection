# Tests
To test the module once you've cloned the repo, please some *partially* protected files in the `Protected` folder and run the `.\Test-Unlock.ps1` script.

Result:
- each file should be extracted to the `Unprotected` folder with password protections removed according to the parameters you pass
- `TEMP` folders created should be tidied up
